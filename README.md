# KNEC DICT Module 3 AI Tutor Bot

## Project Description

This project is an AI-powered web-based tutor designed specifically to assist students with the **KNEC Diploma in Information Communication Technology (DICT) Module 3 syllabus**. Built with Flask, this bot leverages the power of Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to provide clear, concise, and relevant explanations for a wide range of topics within the curriculum.

The primary goal is to offer an interactive learning experience where students can query the bot about specific DICT Module 3 concepts and receive well-formatted, easy-to-understand explanations, including practical code examples where applicable.

* **Rich Formatting:** AI responses are rendered using Markdown, providing:
    * Clear headings for structured content.
    * Bold text for key terms and emphasis.
    * Bullet points and numbered lists for easy readability.
* **Code Highlighting:** Code examples provided by the AI are beautifully formatted with syntax highlighting, making them easy to read and understand.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple web interface built with Flask allows for easy topic input and clear display of explanations.

## Technologies Used
